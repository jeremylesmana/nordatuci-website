She is particularly interested in the nervous system, but also works on heart, limb, and most recently, skin. In addition to using classical methods of developmental genetics and molecular biology, her laboratory increasingly employs the quantitative approaches of genomics and systems biology to understand the fundamental principles that underlie the control of stem cell lineages, how this control influences morphogenesis and tissue size, and the molecular etiology of birth defects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                      <p class="u-text u-text-7"> Albert La Spada graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in Biology in 1986.&nbsp; While a M.D. - Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, La Spada identified the cause of X-linked spinal &amp; bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) as an expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the androgen receptor gene.&nbsp; As the first disorder shown to be caused by an expanded repeat tract, this discovery of a novel type of genetic mutation led to the emergence of a new field of study.&nbsp; After completing training as a Clinical Genetics fellow and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Physician Postdoctoral Fellow, he joined the faculty at the University of Washington Medical Center in 1998, and became a Professor of Laboratory Medicine, Medicine (Medical Genetics), Pathology, and Neurology (Neurogenetics).&nbsp; In 2009, Dr. La Spada accepted the position of Professor and Division Head of Genetics in Pediatrics, Cellular &amp; Molecular Medicine, and Neurosciences at the University of California, San Diego, and was a founding faculty member of the UCSD Institute for Genomic Medicine and Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine.&nbsp; Dr. La Spada was recruited as the founding Director of the Duke Center for Neurodegeneration &amp; Neurotherapeutics, was appointed Distinguished Professor of Neurology, Neurobiology, and Cell Biology, and held the Lincoln Financial Endowed Chair at the Duke University School of Medicine.&nbsp; In 2020, Dr. La Spada joined the faculty of the University of California Irvine as Distinguished Professor of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine and Neurology, and founded the UCI Institute for Neurotherapeutics which he directs.&nbsp; He also currently serves as the Associate Dean for Research Development at the UC Irvine School of Medicine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>Dr. La Spada's research is focused upon neurodegenerative disease, and he is seeking the molecular events that underlie neurodegeneration and neuron cell death in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), SBMA, Huntington’s Disease, ALS, and Parkinson’s disease.&nbsp; He and his team have uncovered evidence for transcription dysregulation, perturbed bioenergetics, and altered protein quality control as contributing factors to neuron dysfunction.&nbsp; By reproducing molecular pathology in mice and in neurons derived from human patient stem cells, Dr. La Spada has begun to develop therapies to treat these disorders.&nbsp; Dr. La Spada has been the recipient of grants and awards from the National Institutes of Health, Muscular Dystrophy Association, Hereditary Disease Foundation, American Federation for Aging Research, Packard Center for ALS Research, Michael J. Fox Foundation, and Harrington Discovery Institute.&nbsp; Among his awards is the Paul Beeson Physician Faculty Scholar Aging Research Award.&nbsp; In 2006, Dr. La Spada was inducted into the American Society for Clinical Investigation. &nbsp;​In 2007, he was bestowed with the Lieberman Award by the Hereditary Disease Foundation for excellence in Huntington’s Disease research, and in 2011, he received the Molecular Mechanisms of Neurodegeneration Distinguished Research Award in Milan, Italy.&nbsp; In 2013, Dr. La Spada was inducted into the Association of American Physicians, and in 2015, Dr. La Spada was selected as a Gund-Harrington Scholar for his translational research accomplishments.&nbsp; In 2018, Dr. La Spada became a funded member of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s Neurodegeneration Challenge Network, after an international competition, and in 2019, Dr. La Spada was selected to present the Sayer Lecture at the National Eye Institute at the N.I.H.<br>

                      <p class="u-text u-text-11"> Stephanie Cherqui is Associate Professor in the Department of Pediatrics, Division of Genetics at the University of California San Diego. The main focus of her lab is the development of stem cell and gene therapy-based therapeutic approaches for genetic disorders, and the understanding of the mechanism of action for hematopoietic stem cell-mediated tissue repair. She established that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell transplantation could reverse multi-organ degenerative disorders, even in the context of an intracellular membrane protein such as in the case of cystinosis, a lysosomal storage disorder. Her work led to the first in human HSPC gene therapy clinical trial for cystinosis. She is now applying this strategy to other disorders including the neuro-muscular degenerative disease, Friedreich’s ataxia.<br>
                        <br>Cherqui received her Ph.D in 2002 at Necker hospital (Paris, France) and was appointed Assistant Professor at The Scripps Research Institute in 2009. She joined UC San Diego in 2012. She is the Chair of the Cystinosis Stem Cell and Gene Therapy Consortium, and former chair of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASCGT) Gene and Cell Therapy of Genetic and Metabolic Diseases committee. She is also a member of the Scientific Review Board of the Cystinosis Research Foundation and a Scientific Council member for the Cure Cystinosis International Registry (CCIR).

An NIH K-award allowed him to develop new directions of research into nutrition and transport physiology in the brain, and he initiated collaborations with Leslie Thompson and her group regarding therapies for Huntington’s disease. His current position is in the Institute for Memory Impairment and Neurological Disorders at UCI where he has been the lead research scientist on California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) funded projects awarded to Leslie Thompson. Dr. Reidling coordinates the stem cell and mouse groups implantation studies participating in multiple technical aspects of the project, manages team members, performs administrative duties for CIRM related documents (progress reports and proposals) and is responsible for project progress, designing experiments and communicating results to Leslie Thompson and collaborators.</p>
