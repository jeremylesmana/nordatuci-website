        <p class="u-text u-text-4"> The development of genome editing and the discovery that Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonuclease has solved the "medicinal chemistry" problem for the vast majority of Mendelian disease. Specifically in the case of blood disorders, 30 years of advances in cell and gene therapy have provided the complete preclinical (efficacy, safety, CMC) foundation to advance a Cas9-driven genome editing strategy for any N=1 mutation to a first-in-one-human clinical trial. Encouragingly, cognate efforts using antisense oligonucleotide technology have reduced this exact notion to clinical practice. Despite all this, should current trends continue, &lt;10% of all Mendelian disorders of the blood will be treated using CRISPR-Cas in the clinic over the course of the next 5-10 years. Bridging the gap between the fact that Cas9 can be used to repair any mutation in laboratory, but not clinical, practice is a multifaceted challenge to be solved over the next decade. This will require innovation across the entire problem space - Cas engineering, delivery, novel methods of assessing efficacy and safety, CMC, regulatory, and health justice.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-6"> Transcriptomopathies: A Window on the Origins of Birth Defects</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-7"> Birth defects are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, highlighting the pressing need to identify their causes.&nbsp; Because the incidence of birth defects is particularly high in some genetic syndromes, animal models of these syndromes provide an opportunity to identify causal factors and determine if these same causal factors also play a role in non-syndromic birth defects.&nbsp; Our laboratory studies vertebrate animal models of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), which is primarily caused by haploinsufficiency for NIPBL, a gene whose product is involved in cohesin loading and global regulation of transcription. CdLS is considered a canonical transcriptomopathy – a disorder caused by mutation in a gene whose product alters the structure of chromatin and/or disrupts other processes that affect the process of transcription globally. Congenital heart defects (CHD) occur in ~30% of individuals with CdLS, and we have concentrated on understanding the origins of these defects in Nipbl+/- mice, a model for human CdLS.&nbsp; By focusing on earlier and earlier stages of development, and by taking our studies to the single cell level of transcriptional profiling, we are uncovering new evidence suggesting that the outcome of transcriptional dysregulation resulting from NIPBL haploinsufficiency results in the misallocation of cells at the very earliest stages of development (gastrulation), and that divergent gene expression within these altered cell population causes changes in tissue and organ size, as well as left-right patterning of developing organs, which then manifest as structural birth defects and pathological changes in gene expression and organ function, at late stages of development.&nbsp; Funded by NIH-NHBLI (ALC and ADL).</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-11"> Using Zebrafish Models to Understand Rare Craniofacial Birth Defects</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-12"> Craniofacial skeletal disorders are among the most common features of human birth defects, though most are fairly rare on their own. A likely explanation for specific effects on the skull in many cases is its unique origin from embryonic neural crest cells, rather than mesoderm, which forms the axial and limb skeletons. We have performed forward genetic screens in zebrafish for mutants that disrupt the craniofacial skeleton, and of the hundreds of mutants identified, many turn out to disrupt genes associated with human birth defects. I will discuss two of these that we have investigated in great detail, providing insights into the developmental causes of the mutant phenotypes. One is a mutant in the transcription factor activator protein alpha(Tfap2a), mutations in which cause human branchio-oculo-facial syndrome, which disrupts both craniofacial and auditory systems. Our studies in zebrafish have demonstrated that Tfap2a is required for very early steps of neural crest development and sits at the head of a fascinating gene regulatory network, components of which are associated with other neural crest andcraniofacial disorders. The second gene that I will highlight is Endothelin-1 (Edn1), a secreted signaling peptide and potent vasoconstrictor. Mutations in the Edn1 signaling pathway cause human auriculocondylar syndrome, which also disrupts craniofacial and auditory structures. Our studies in zebrafish have demonstrated that Edn1 works in concert with other signals to establish the identities of neural crest cells, and the bones that they form in the lower (mandibular) and upper (maxillary) jaws. We have also built a gene regulatory network surrounding Edn1 signaling. We are currently performing single cell RNA-sequencing studies to understand how this and other signaling pathways control cell fate determination during craniofacial development and to identify additional genes as candidates for other rare (as well as common) human craniofacial disorders.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-15"> Cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of cystine within the lysosomes of all organs and caused by mutations in the CTNS gene encoding the transmembrane lysosomal cystine transporter, cystinosin. Major complications of cystinosis include early renal Fanconi syndrome, kidney failure requiring transplantation, eye defects that can lead to blindness, hypothyroidism, and neuromuscular problem causing swallowing dysfunction and fatal pulmonary aspiration. Cysteamine, the FDA-approved drug to treat cystinosis, only delay the progression of the disease. Preclinical studies showed that transplantation of wild-type hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in Ctns -/- mice leads to cystine content decrease in every tissue tested, as well as functional and structural improvement in kidney, eye and thyroid. The mechanism of action involves lysosomal cross-correction via tunneling nanotubes from graft-derived macrophages. We developed an autologous transplantation approach of HSPCs modified ex vivo using a self-inactivating-lentiviral vector to introduce a functional version of the CTNS cDNA, pCCL-CTNS (drug product name: CTNS-RD-04). We performed pharmacology and toxicology studies, and manufacturing development for this strategy, and received FDA-approval for a phase I/II clinical trial on December 19, 2018.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-18"> In 2014 everything changed. The life of a successful veterinary specialist designing medical devices and enthralled in clinical research for animals came to a screeching halt. My little girl Quincy, 5.5 months old, was diagnosed with a random, rare, neurogenetic disorder called Angelman syndrome (AS).&nbsp; Through pure naivety, scientific understanding, and medical education, I knew a treatment for this disorder was possible, knowing there was absolutely no approved therapeutics. After countless conference calls, scientific stalking, and a dream, I started my journey from becoming the Chief Science Officer of the largest non-governmental research funding foundation in AS (FAST), to the co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of GeneTx Biotherapeutics, focused on developing an antisense oligonucleotide for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. The foundation funded an academic lab to develop this ASO and deeply understand the unique phenomenon associated with AS (imprinting). This funding resulted in the discovery of a unique genetic region that could be exploited, essentially turning on the gene missing in neurons of those with AS. It was at that time that the foundation decided to develop this potential disease modifying therapeutic, recruit some of the most experienced experts in ASO drug development, and drive the program for a first in human clinical trial. Through determination, supportive expertise, and amazing consultants, GeneTx completed IND enabling studies and launched a clinical trial in 2020. The vision and dedication of parents and loved ones drove this program, allowing the team to remain singularly focused on a population approximating 1:15,000.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-24"> Huntington’s disease (HD), a genetic neurodegenerative disorder, primarily impacts the striatum and cortex with progressive loss of medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) and pyramidal neurons, disrupting cortico-striatal circuitry. A promising regenerative therapeutic strategy of transplanting human neural stem cells (hNSCs) is challenged by the need for long-term functional integration. We have found that hNSCs transplanted into the striatum of HD mouse models differentiate into electrophysiologically active neurons, ameliorate behavioral deficits, increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and reduce mutant Huntington (mHTT) accumulation. Patch clamp recordings, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy demonstrate that hNSCs implanted into mice for 8 months differentiate into diverse neuronal populations, including MSN- and interneuron-like cells. Remarkably, hNSCs receive synaptic inputs, innervate host neurons, and improve membrane and synaptic properties. Overall, the findings support hNSC transplantation for further evaluation and clinical development for HD.</p>

          <br>Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a rare inherited retinal disease affecting 1 in 80,000 people,&nbsp; yet is the most common form of inherited blindness in children. LCA is caused by a dysfunctional&nbsp; mutation in one of many genes that are important for the function of photoreceptor and retinal&nbsp; pigment epithelial cells. Patients with LCA have severe visual impairment from infancy, and&nbsp; progressively lose their vision to complete blindness by early adulthood. Recently, genome editing&nbsp; with CRISPR technology has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for numerous genetic&nbsp; diseases. Base editors, which are CRISPR-associated engineered proteins, can achieve targeted&nbsp; conversion of a single base pair with high precision and minimal off-target effects. Cytosine base&nbsp; editor (CBE) and adenine base editor (ABE) can convert C•G to T•A or vice versa in the presence&nbsp; of a target-specific single-guide RNA (sgRNA). Here, we hypothesized that base editors can be&nbsp; used to correct the mutations associated with LCA. To test our hypothesis, we used the mouse&nbsp; model of LCA, which harbors a dysfunctional point mutation in the Rpe65 gene (c.130C &gt; T;&nbsp; p.R44X). The Rpe65 gene encodes an essential enzyme that mediates a visual cycle in the eye, and&nbsp; is one of the most common genes associated with LCA. We first designed a single-guide RNA&nbsp; (sgRNA) that can efficiently locate and correct the Rpe65 mutation in the mutant cell line. After&nbsp; validating in vitro, we delivered the selected sgRNA and ABE via lentivirus subretinally to 4- week-old LCA mice and evaluated the post-treatment outcome 5 weeks later. The treated mice&nbsp; showed up to 29% mutation correction without off-target mutations in the eye, as well as the restoration of functional RPE65 protein. The base editing treatment rescued retinal cell activity&nbsp; and visual function in LCA mice, as measured by electroretinography. Neuronal activity of the&nbsp; primary visual cortex in response to visual stimuli was similarly restored, with treated mice&nbsp; exhibiting near-normal firing rates, along with strong selective responses to various stimulus&nbsp; parameters. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of base editing for correcting mutations causing inherited retinal diseases and curing blindness. Base editing&nbsp; technology can provide an alternative treatment model of gene augmentation therapy to&nbsp; permanently rescue the function of a key vision-related protein disabled by mutations.<br>

        <h5 class="u-align-center u-text u-text-38"><b> Role of UHRF1 in Osteosarcoma and Palbociclib’s Mechanism of Action</b>
        </h5>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-39"><b> Kelsey N. Salcido, Claudia A. Benavente</b>
          <br> Osteosarcoma is a rare childhood bone cancer with no therapeutic advances in the last 30 years. Genetic alterations at the RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) gene are associated with increased mortality, metastasis, and poor response to chemotherapy in osteosarcoma. However, the precise mechanism(s) through which this occurs remains to be elucidated. Our lab identified ubiquitin-like with RING finger domain 1 (UHRF1) as a protein overexpressed in osteosarcoma. UHRF1 is involved in epigenetic regulation and is directly regulated by the RB/E2F pathway. We hypothesized that UHRF1 overexpression contributes to osteosarcoma tumor progression. Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology, UHRF1 knock-out (KO) cells were generated to study the role of UHRF1 in osteosarcoma. Through growth curves and colony formation assays, we observed decreased proliferation in several UHRF1 KO osteosarcoma cell lines compared to non-targeting controls. Using scratch wound assay, we also observed a decrease in migration in UHRF1-KO cells. Similarly, induction of UHRF1 overexpression in normal mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) resulted in increased migration. Thus, we found that UHRF1 overexpression in human osteosarcoma cell lines positively regulates proliferation and migration. Interestingly, studies have shown that palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor currently in clinical trials as second line treatment of advanced sarcomas with CDK4 overexpression, decreases proliferation and migration in osteosarcoma cells. However, the mechanism of action by which palbociclib decreases migration remains unknown. Given our results exploring UHRF1, we postulated that palbociclib decreases migration in osteosarcoma cells by decreasing levels of UHRF1. Thus, we treated SJSA-1 cells (CDK4-amplified) UHRF1-KO and controls cells with palbociclib. Our results showed a decrease in the UHRF1 protein expression that correlated with the decrease in migration following treatment with palbociclib in control SJSA-1 osteosarcomas. Removal of UHRF1 in SJSA-1 UHRF1-KO rendered the cells insensitive to the effect of palbociclib. This allows us to conclude that palbociclib decreases migration in osteosarcoma cells through the decrease of UHRF1 levels. We are currently working on reintroducing UHRF1 in UHRF1-knockout cells under an RB/E2F1 independent promoter, to determine whether this also renders osteosarcoma cells insensitive to palbociclib treatment, confirming our results. So far, our studies suggest that UHRF1 plays a role in carcinogenesis and may be a potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma<br>

        </h5>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-41"><b> Lan Weiss, Jillian Vu, Alyaa Shmara, Eshanee Mohanty, Randy Yan, Rebekah Wei, Cheng Cheng, Virginia Kimonis<br></b> Objective: To assess the benefits of colchicine in rescuing the HSPB8-related disease phenotype in our cellular and animal models.<br>
          <br>Background:We have recently reported a family with a novel disorder associated with autosomal dominant Rimmed Vacuolar Myopathy caused by a frameshift mutation: c.515dupC in Heat Shock Protein family B member 8 (HSPB8) gene. HSPB8 is a chaperone involved in the Chaperone Assisted Selective Autophagy (CASA) complex. HSPB8 in conjunction with BAG3 recognizes and promotes the autophagy-mediated removal of misfolded proteins present in several neurodegenerative diseases. Our studies showed that patients with HSPB8 c.515dupC have reduced expression of HSPB8, disrupted TDP-43 and autophagy pathology in patient fibroblasts. A prior high throughput drug screening project in neuronal cells indicated that colchicine was one of the top drugs that significantly increased expression of HSPB8 and of several autophagy players, blocking misfolded TDP-43 accumulation. Our hypothesis was that colchicine would improve the pathology in myoblasts and muscle from mice and also improve muscle weakness.<br>
          <br>Methods:A dose-response study (0.1-1uM, 24h) was carried out to evaluate the optimal concentration of colchicine on HSPB8 patient and age and sex matched control iPSC-derived myoblasts. We also treated our newly created c.515dupC Hspb8 knock-in mouse model with colchicine (0.3 mg/kg/day for 2 months) in the hope of translating these findings to a novel treatment for patients. This dose derived from a previously conducted dose response study.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Results:In the in-vitro study, colchicine increased expression levels of HSPB8 and BAG3 proteins at the lowest concentration 0.1nM but was more pronounced at a concentration of 0.3uM of colchicine.In the in-vivo study, there were no signs of toxicity in mice with colchicine. We observed (1) significant improvement of muscle pathology by H&amp;E staining, (2) increased HSPB8 RNA and protein levels and (3) a trend of amelioration in Rotarod performance in the heterozygous treated group compared with vehicle group. Unexpectedly we found an increase in TDP43 with colchicine. Further studies are ongoing in a larger cohort of animals to verify these findings.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Conclusions:Results from this study indicate that colchicine has the potential for treating HSPB8 associated rimmed vacuolar myopathy and to ameliorate other related neuromuscular disorders.<br>
